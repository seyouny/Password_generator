# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected 
criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML
 and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished 
 user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
